This software is architectured as follows

iptools -This folder hosts the files that are compiled into a static library. 
	image - This folder hosts the files that define an image.
	utility- this folder hosts the files that students store their implemented algorithms.
	
lib- This folder hosts the static libraries associated with this software.

project- This folder hosts the files that will be compiled into executables.
	bin- This folder hosts the binary executables created in the project directory.



*** INSTALATION ***

On Windows

1) Install MinGW (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/).
2) Install Make application for Windows (http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm).
3) Open command line and go to directory you unzip project.
4) Execite make.bat  

As a result you should get iptool.exe in project/bin directory.

NOTE: probably you will need to add location of MinGW files(gcc.exe, g++.exe and etc) and Make files(make.exe) to Path envirement variable. 


*** FUNCTIONS ***

1. Add intensity: add
Increase the intensity for a gray-level image.

2. Binarization: binarize
Binarize the pixels with the threshold.

3. Scaling: Scale
Reduce or expand the heigh and width with twp scale factors.
Scaling factor = 2: double height and width of the input image.
Scaling factor = 0.5: half height and width of the input image.



*** PARAMETERS ***

There are for parameters:
1. the input file name;
2. the output file name;
3. the name of the filter. Use "add", "binarize", and "scale" for your filters;
4. the value for adding intensity, threshold value for binarize filter, or the scaling factor for scale filter.


*** Run the program: iptool.exe parameters.txt


*** Important information ***

Application assumes the next format of input image (ppm/pgm) file:
line1: <version>
line2: <#columns> <#rows>
line3: <max_value>
line4-end-of-file:<pix1><pix2>...<pix_n>

if it is a grayscale image then every pixel is a char value. If it is a RGB image then every pixel is a set of 3 char values: <red><green><blue>

Thus, if you have a problem with reading image, the first thing you should check is input file format.
